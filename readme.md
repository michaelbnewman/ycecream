Do you ever use `print()` or `log()` to debug your code? If so,  ycecream, or `y` for short, will make printing debug information a lot sweeter.
And on top of that, you get some basic benchmarking functionality.

# Installation

Installing ycecream with pip is easy.
```
$ pip install ycecream
```
or when you want to upgrade,
```
$ pip install ycecream --upgrade
```

Alternatively, ycecream.py can be juist copied into you current work directory from GitHub (https://github.com/salabim/ycecream).

No dependencies!


# Inspect variables and expressions

Have you ever printed variables or expressions to debug your program? If you've
ever typed something like

```
print(add2(1000))
```

or the more thorough

```
print("add2(1000)", add2(1000)))
```
or (for Python >= 3.8 only):
```
print(f"{add2(1000) =}")
```

then `y()` is here to help. With arguments, `y()` inspects itself and prints
both its own arguments and the values of those arguments.

```
from ycecream import y

def add2(i):
    return i + 2

y(add2(1000))
```

prints
```
y| add2(1000): 1002
```

Similarly,

```
from ycecream import y
class X:
    a = 3
world = {"EN": "world", "NL": "wereld", "FR": "monde", "DE": "Welt"}

y(world, X.a)
```

prints
```
y| world: {"EN": "world", "NL": "wereld", "FR": "monde", "DE": "Welt"}, X.a: 3
```
Just give `y()` a variable or expression and you're done. Sweet, isn't it?


# Inspect execution

Have you ever used `print()` to determine which parts of your program are
executed, and in which order they're executed? For example, if you've ever added
print statements to debug code like

```
def add2(i):
    print("enter")
    result = i + 2
    print("exit")
    return result
```
then `y()` helps here, too. Without arguments, `y()` inspects itself and
prints the calling filename, line number, and parent function.

```
from ycecream import y
def add2(i):
    y()
    result = i + 2
    y()
    return result
y(add2(1000))
```

prints something like
```
y| #3 in add2()
y| #5 in add2()
y| add2(1000): 1002
```
Just call `y()` and you're done. Isn't that sweet?


# Return Value

`y()` returns its argument(s), so `y()` can easily be inserted into
pre-existing code.

```
from ycecream import y
def add2(i):
    return i + 2
b = y(add2(1000))
y(b)
```
prints
```
y| add2(1000): 1002
y| b: 1002
```
# Debug entry and exit of function calls

When you apply `y()` as a decorator to a function or method, both the entry and exit can be tracked.
The (keyword) arguments passed will be shown and upon return, the return value.

```
from ycecream import y
@y()
def mul(x, y):
    return x * y
    
print(mul(5, 7))
```
prints
```
y| called mul(5, 7)
y| returned 35 from mul(5, 7) in 0.000006 seconds
35
```
It is possible to suppress the print-out of either the enter or the exit information with
the show_enter and show_exit parameters, like:

```
from ycecream import y
@y(show_exit=False)
def mul(x, y):
    return x * y
    
print(mul(5, 7))
```
prints
```
y| called mul(5, 7)
35
```
Note that it is possible to use `y` as a decorator without the parentheses, like
```
@y
def diode(x):
    return 0 if x<0 else x
```
, but this might not work correctly when the def/class definition spawns more than one line. So, always use `y()` or
`y(<parameters>)` when used as a decorator.  

# Benchmarking with ycecream

If you decorate a function or method with y, you will be offered the duration between entry and exit (in seconds) as a bonus.

That opens the door to simple benchmarking, like:
```
from ycecream import y
import time

@y(show_enter=False,show_line_number=True)
def do_sort(i):
    n = 10 ** i
    x = sorted(list(range(n)))
    return f"{n:9d}"  
    
for i in range(8):
    do_sort(i)
```
the ouput will show the effects of the population size on the sort speed:
```
y| #5 ==> returned '        1' from do_sort(0) in 0.000027 seconds
y| #5 ==> returned '       10' from do_sort(1) in 0.000060 seconds
y| #5 ==> returned '      100' from do_sort(2) in 0.000748 seconds
y| #5 ==> returned '     1000' from do_sort(3) in 0.001897 seconds
y| #5 ==> returned '    10000' from do_sort(4) in 0.002231 seconds
y| #5 ==> returned '   100000' from do_sort(5) in 0.024014 seconds
y| #5 ==> returned '  1000000' from do_sort(6) in 0.257504 seconds
y| #5 ==> returned ' 10000000' from do_sort(7) in 1.553495 seconds
```

It is also possible to time any code by using y as a context manager, e.g.
```
with y():
    time.sleep(1)
```
wil print something like
```
y| enter
y| exit in 1.000900 seconds
```
You can include parameters here as well:
```
with y(show_context=True, show_time=True):
    time.sleep(1)
```
will print somethink like:
```
y| #8 @ 13:20:32.605903 ==> enter
y| #8 @ 13:20:33.609519 ==> exit in 1.003358 seconds
```

Finally, to help with timing code, you can request the current delta with
```
y().delta
```
or (re)set it  with
```
y().delta = 0
```
So, e.g. to time a section of code:
```
y.delta = 0
time.sleep(1)
duration = y.delta
y(duration)
```
might print:
```
y| duration: 1.0001721999999997
```

# Miscellaneous

`y(*args, as_str=True)` is like `y(*args)` but the output is returned as a string instead
of written to output.

```
from ycecream import y
hello = "world"
s = y(hello, as_str=True)
print(s, end="")
```
prints
```
y| hello: 'world'
```

Ycecreams's output can be entirely disabled, and optionally  later re-enabled, with
`ycecream.enable(False)` and `ycecream.enable(True)` respectively. The function always returns
the current (new) setting.
Note that this function refers to ALL output from ycecream.
```
from ycecream import y, enable
yd = y.clone(show_delta=True)
y(1)
yd(2)
enable(False)
y(3)
yd(4)
enable(True)
y(5)
yd(6)
print(enable())
```
prints
```
y| 1
y| delta=0.011826 ==> 2
y| 5
y| delta=0.044893 ==> 6
True
```
Note that `y()` continues to return its arguments when disabled, of course.

# Configuration

For the configuration, it is important to realize that `y` is an instance of the `ycecream.Y` class, which has
a number of configuration attributes:
* `prefix`
* `output`
* `serialize`
* `show_line_numbert`
* `show_time`
* `show_delta`
* `show_enter`
* `show_exit`
* `sort_dicts`
* `enabled`
* `line_length`
* `compact`
* `indent`
* `depth` 
* `context_delimiter`
* `pair_delimiter`

It is perfectly ok to set/get any of these attributes directly.

But, it is also possible to apply configuration directly in the call to `y`:
So, it is possible to say
```
from ycecream import y
y(12, prefix="==> ")
```
, which will print
```
==> 12
```
It is also possible to configure y permanently with the configure method. 
```
y.configure(prefix="==> ")
y(12)
```
will print
```
==> 12
```
It is arguably easier to say:
```
y.prefix = "==> "
y(12)
```
to print
```
==> 12
```
Yet another way to configure y is by instantiating Y with the required configuration:
```
y = Y(prefix="==> ")
y(12)
```
will print
```
==> 12
```

Or, yet another possibility is to clone y (optionally with modified attributes):
```
yd1 = y.clone(show_date=True)
yd2 = y.clone()
yd2.cunfigure(show_date=True)
```
After this `yd1` and `yd2` will behave similarly.

## prefix
```
from ycecream import y
y('world', prefix='hello -> ')
```
prints
```
hello -> 'world'
```

`prefix` can also be a function, too.

```
import time
from ycecream import y
def unix_timestamp():
    return f"{int(time.time())} "
hello = "world"
y = Y(prefix=unix_timestamp)
y(hello) 
```
prints
```
1613635601 hello: 'world'
```

## output
This will allow the output to be handled by something else than the default (output being written to stderr).

The `output` attribute can be

* a callable that accepts at least one parameter (the text to be printed)
* a string or Path object that will be used as the filename
* a text file that is open for writing/appending

In the example below, 
```
from ycecream import y
import sys
y(1, output=print)
y(2, output=sys.stdout
with open("test", "a+") as f:
    y(3, output=f)
y(4, output="")
```
* `y| 1` will be printed to stdout
* `y| 2` will be printed to stdout
* `y| 3` will be appended to the file test
* `y| 4` will *disappear*

As `output` may be any callable, you can even use this to automatically log any `y` output:
```
from ycecream import y
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level="INFO")
log = logging.getLogger("demo")
y.configure(output=log.info)
a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
y(a)
a.remove(4)
y(a)
```
will print to stderr:
```
INFO:demo:y| a: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
INFO:demo:y| a: {1, 2, 3, 5}
```
Finally, you can specify the following strings:
```
"stderr"           to print to stderr
"stdput"           to print to stdout
"null" or ""       to completely ignore (dummy) output 
"logging.debug"    to use logging.debug
"logging.info"     to use logging.info
"logging.warning"  to use logging.warning
"logging.error"    to use logging.error
"logging.critical" to use logging.critical
```
E.g.
```
from ycecream import y
import sys
y.configure(output="stdout")
```
to print to stdout.

## serialize
This will allow to specify how argument values are to be
serialized to displayable strings. The default is pformat (from pprint), but this can be changed to,
for example, to handle non-standard datatypes in a custom fashion.
The serialize function should accept at least one parameter.
The function can optionally accept the keyword arguments `width` and `sort_dicts`, `compact`, `indent` and `depth`.
```
from ycecream import y
def add_len(obj):
    if hasattr(obj, "__len__"):
        add = f" [len={len(obj)}]"
    else:
        add = ""
    return f"{repr(obj)}{add}"

l = list(range(7))
hello = "world"
y(7, hello, l, serialize=add_len)
```   
prints
```
y| 7, hello: 'world' [len=5], l: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] [len=7]
```

## show_line_number
If True, adds the `y()` call's filename, line number, and parent function to `y()`'s output.

```
from ycecream import Y
y = Y(show_line_number=True)
hello="world"
y(hello)
```
prints like
```
y| #4 ==> hello: 'world'
```
Note that if you call `y` without any arguments, the line number is always shown, regardless of the status `show_line_number`.

See below for an explanation of the information provided.

## show_time
If True, adds the current time to `y()`'s output.

```
from ycecream import Y
y =  Y(show_time=True)
hello="world"
y(hello)
```
prints something like
```
y| @ 13:01:47.588125 ==> hello: 'world'
```

## show_delta
If True, adds the number of seconds since the start of the program to `y()`'s output.
```
from ycecream import y
import time
y.configure(show_delta=True)
allô="monde"
hallo
y(hello)
time.sleep(1)
y(âllo)
```
prints something like
```
y| delta=0.021002 ==> hello: 'world'
y| delta=1.053234 ==> âllo: 'monde'
```

## show_enter
When used as a decorator or context manager, by default, ycecream ouputs a line when the decorated the
function is called  or the context manager is entered.

With `show_enter=False` this line can be suppressed.

## show_exit
When used as a decorator or context manager, by default, ycecream ouputs a line when the decorated the
function returned or the context manager is exited.

With `show_exit=False` this line can be suppressed.


## line_length
This attribute is used to specify the line length (for wrapping). The default is 80.
Ycecream always tries to keep all output on one line, but if it can't it will wrap:
```
d = dict(a1=1,a2=dict(a=1,b=1,c=3),a3=list(range(10)))
y(d)
y(d, line_length=120)
```
prints
```
y|
    d:
        {'a1': 1,
         'a2': {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 3},
         'a3': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]}
y| d: {'a1': 1, 'a2': {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 3}, 'a3': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]}
```

## compact
This attribute is used to specify the compact parameter for `pformat` (see the pprint documentation
for details). `compact` is False by default.
```
a = 9 * ["0123456789"]
y(a)
y(a, compact=True)
```
prints
```
y|
    a:
        ['0123456789',
         '0123456789',
         '0123456789',
         '0123456789',
         '0123456789',
         '0123456789',
         '0123456789',
         '0123456789',
         '0123456789']
y|
    a:
        ['0123456789', '0123456789', '0123456789', '0123456789', '0123456789',
         '0123456789', '0123456789', '0123456789', '0123456789']
```
## indent
This attribute is used to specify the indent parameter for `pformat` (see the pprint documentation
for details). `indent` is 1 by default.
```
s = "01234567890012345678900123456789001234567890"
y( [s, [s]])
y( [s, [s]], indent=4)
```
prints
```
y|
    [s, [s]]:
        ['01234567890012345678900123456789001234567890',
         ['01234567890012345678900123456789001234567890']]
y|
    [s, [s]]:
        [   '01234567890012345678900123456789001234567890',
            ['01234567890012345678900123456789001234567890']]
```

## depth
This attribute is used to specify the depth parameter for `pformat` (see the pprint documentation
for details). `depth` is `None` by default, which means no restrictions. 
```
s = "01234567890012345678900123456789001234567890"
y([s,[s,[s,[s,s]]]])
y([s,[s,[s,[s,s]]]], depth=3)
```
prints
```
y|
    [s,[s,[s,[s,s]]]]:
        ['01234567890012345678900123456789001234567890',
         ['01234567890012345678900123456789001234567890',
          ['01234567890012345678900123456789001234567890',
           ['01234567890012345678900123456789001234567890',
            '01234567890012345678900123456789001234567890']]]]
y|
    [s,[s,[s,[s,s]]]]:
        ['01234567890012345678900123456789001234567890',
         ['01234567890012345678900123456789001234567890',
          ['01234567890012345678900123456789001234567890', [...]]]]
```

## wrap_indent
This specifies the indent string if the output does not fit in the line_length (has to be wrapped).
Rather than a string, wrap_indent can be also be an integer, in which case the wrap_indent will be that amount of blanks.
The default is 4 blanks.

E.g.
```
d = dict(a1=1,a2=dict(a=1,b=1,c=3),a3=list(range(10)))
y(d, wrap_indent="  ")
y(d, wrap_indent="....")
y(d, wrap_indent=2)
```
prints
```
y|
  d:
    {'a1': 1,
     'a2': {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 3},
     'a3': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]}
y|
....d:
........{'a1': 1,
........ 'a2': {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 3},
........ 'a3': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]}
y|
  d:
    {'a1': 1,
     'a2': {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 3},
     'a3': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]}
```



## enable
Can be used to disable the output:

```
from ycecream import y

y.configure(prefix="==> ", enable=False)
world = "perfect"
y(hello)
y.configure(enable=True)
world = "on fire"
```
prints
```
==> hello: world = 'on fire'
```
and nothing about a perfect world.

## sort_dicts
By default, ycecream does not sort dicts (printed by pprint). However, it is possible to get the
default pprint behaviour (i.e. sorting dicts) with the sorted_dicts attribute:

```
world = {"EN": "world", "NL": "wereld", "FR": "monde", "DE": "Welt"}
y(world))
s1 = y(world, sort_dicts=False)
s2 = y(world, sort_dicts=True)
```
prints
```
y| world: {'EN': 'world', 'NL': 'wereld', 'FR': 'monde', 'DE': 'Welt'}
y| world: {'EN': 'world', 'NL': 'wereld', 'FR': 'monde', 'DE': 'Welt'}
y| world: {'DE': 'Welt', 'EN': 'world', 'FR': 'monde', 'NL': 'wereld'}
```

## context_delimiter
By default the line_number, time and/or delta are followed by ` ==> `.
It is possible to change this with the attribute `context_delimiter`:
```
a="abcd"
y(a)
y(a, show_time=True, context_delimiter = ' \u279c ')
```
prints:
```
y| @ 12:56:11.341650 ==> a: 'abcd'
y| @ 12:56:11.485567 ➜ a: 'abcd'
```

## pair_delimiter
By default, pairs (on one line) are separated by `, `.
It is possible to change this with the attribute ` pair_delimiter`:
```
a="abcd"
b=1
c=1000
d=list("ycecream")
y(a,(b,c),d)
y(a,(b,c),d, pair_delimiter=" | ")
```
prints
```
y| a: 'abcd', (b,c): (1, 1000), d: ['y', 'c', 'e', 'c', 'r', 'e', 'a', 'm']
y| a: 'abcd' | (b,c): (1, 1000) | d: ['y', 'c', 'e', 'c', 'r', 'e', 'a', 'm']
```

# Interpreting the line number information
When `show_line_number` is True or y() is used without any parameters, the output will contain the line number like:
```
y| #3 ==> a: 'abcd'
```
If the line resides in another file than the main file, the filename (without the path) will be shown as well:
```
y| #30[foo.py] ==> foo: 'Foo'
```
And finally when used in a function or method, that functiuon/method will be shown as well:
```
y| #456[foo.py] in square_root ==> x: 123
```

# Configuring at import time
It can be useful to configure ycecream at import time. This can be done by providing a `ycecream.json` file which
can contain any attribute configuration overriding the standard settings.
E.g. if there is an `ycecream.json` file with the following contents
```
{
    "output": "stdout",
    "show_time": true,
    "line_length": 120`
    'compact' : true
}
```
in the same folder as the application, this program:
```
from ycecream import y
hello = "world"
y(hello)
```
will print to stdout (rather than stderr):
```
y| @ 14:53:41.392190 ==> hello: 'world'
```
At import time the sys.path will be searched for, in that order, to find an `ycecream.json` file and use that. This mean that 
you can place an `ycecream.json` file in the site-packages folder where `ycecream` is installed to always use
these modified settings.

Note that not-specified attributes will remain the default settings.

For obvious reasons, it is not possible to specify `serialize` in an ycecream.json file.

# Working with multiple instances of Y
Normally, only the `y()` object (which is an instance of Y) is used.

It can be useful to have multiple instances, e.g. when some of the debugging has to be done with context information
and others requires an alternative prefix.

THere are several ways to obtain a new instance of Y:

*    by using `Y()`
*    by using `y.new()`, which is essentially the same as Y, but there's no need to import Y explicitely
*    by using `y.clone()`, which copies all attributes from y()
*    with y() used as a context manager
    
In either case, attributes can be added to override these:

### Example
```
from ycecream import y, Y
y_with_line_number = Y(show_line_number=True)
y_with_new_prefix = y.new(prefix="==> ")
y_with_new_prefix_and_time = y_with_new_prefix.clone(show_time=True)
hello="world"
y_with_line_number(hello)
y_with_new_prefix(hello)
y_with_new_prefix_and_time(hello)
with y(prefix="ycm ") as ycm:
    ycm(hello)
    y(hello)
```

# Test script

On GitHub is a file `test_ycecream.py` that tests (and thus also demonstrates) most of the functionality
of ycecream.

It is very useful to have a look at the tests to see the features (some may be not covered in this readme).

# Alternative installation

With `install ycecream from github.py`, you can install the ycecream.py directly from GitHub to the site packages (as if it was a pip install).

With `install ycecream.py`, you can install the ycecream.py in your current directory to the site packages (as if it were a pip install).

Both files can be found in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/salabim/ycecream).

# Limitations
It is not possible to use ycecream:
* in a REPL or other interactive environment
* from a frozen application (e.g. packaged with PyInstaller)
* when the underlying source code has changed during execution

# Implementation details
Although not important for using the package, here are some implementation details:
* ycecream.py contains the complete (slightly modifief) source of the asttokens and executing, in
   order to offer the required source lookups
* ycecream.py contains the complete source of pprint as of Python 3.8 in order to support the sort_dicts parameter
* in order to support using y() as a decorator and a context manager, ycecream caches the complete source of any source
    file that uses y()h   


# Acknowledgement
The **ycecream** pacakage is inspired by the **IceCream** package, but is a 
nearly complete rewrite. See https://github.com/gruns/icecream

# Differences with IceCream

The ycecream module was originally a fork of IceCream, but has many differences:

* ycecream can't colourize the output
* ycecream runs only on Python 3.6 and higher
* ycecream uses y as the standard interface, whereas IceCream uses ic.
* yceceam has no dependencies. IceCream on the other hand has many (asttoken, colorize, pyglets, ...).
* ycecream is just one .py file, whereas IceCream consists of a number of .py files. That makes it possible to use ycecream without even (pip) installing it. Just copy ycecream.py to your work directory.
* ycecream can be used as a decorator of a function showing the enter and/or exit event as well as the duration.
* ycecream can be used as a context manager to benchmark code.
* ycecream has a PEP8 (Pythonic) API. Less important for the user, the actual code is also fully PEP8 compatible.
* ycecream uses a different API to configuration (rather than IceCream's configureOutput method)
* ycecream can toggle line number, time and delta inclusion independently
* ycecream does not sort dicts by default. This behaviour can be controlled with the `sort_dict` parameter. (This is implemented by including the pprint 3.8 source code)
* ycecream can use the compact, indent and depath parameters of pprint to allow for more formatting flexibility
* ycecream can be configured from a json file, thus overriding some or all default settings at import time.
* ycecream has a line_length attribute that is observed correctly.
* ycecream indents output by 4 blanks (overridable) rather than IceCream's indentation that depends on the length of prefix.
* ycecream uses pytest for the test scripts rather than IceCream's unittest script.
