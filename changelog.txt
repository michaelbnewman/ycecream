version 1.1.5  2021-02-05
=========================
Now, the line_length is properly observed and indentation is not anymore dependent on prefix. 
Instead by default 4 blanks (this can overriden with the wrap_indent attribute) are used as an indent.

The attributes context_delimiter and pair_delimiter are now documented.

Exception NoSourceAvailableError is now correctly raised.

Internal change: complete overhaul of formatting.

version 1.1.4  2021-02-03 
=========================
Increased the resolution of show_date and show_time (now microseconds).
Delta now start on creation of an Y object and is thus different for each instance.

It is now possible to query the current delta with Y.delta and to reset it with Y.delta = 0

y() can now also be used as a context manager, primarily to time sections of code rather than a function or method:
|   with y():
|       time.sleep(1)
will print
|    y| enter
|    y| exit in 1.000822 seconds    

If you also want to see where the context manager was defined:

|   with y(show_context=True):
|       time.sleep(1)
will print something like:
|   y| x6.py:19 ==> enter
|   y| x6.py:19 ==> exit in 1.000544 seconds

As with the decorator y, the show_enter and show_exit parameters may be used to show/hide that information.

The ouput attribute can now also be the string
    "logging.debug", "logging.info", "logging.warning", "logging.error" or "logging.critical"
, which is primarily useful when a configuration is read from ycecream.json .
Note that
    y.configure(logging.info) 
ie essentially the same as
    y.configure("logging.info")
    
Internal change: now uses time.perf_counter() to improve accuracy of timings


version 1.1.3  2021-03-02 
=========================
There was still a __all__ definition left over, which caused a problem when using ycecream from site-packages
(installed with pip).
Bug fixed.

version 1.1.2  2021-02-28 
=========================
It is now possible to use the string 'stderr', 'stdout' and 'null' as output attributes.

Ycecream will now try and read ycecream.json (in the directories in sys.path) to override
the default values, e.g.
    {
    "prefix": "==> ",
    "show_time": true,
    "line_length": 120
    }

Internal change: all defaults are now stored in a class defaults.
Internal change: phased out stderr_print.

version 1.1.1  2021-02-25
=========================
The y decorator now also adds the duration of the function/method call on exit, like
y| returned None from wait(5) in 5.004965 seconds
This can be useful as a basic way to benchmark a function.

version 1.1.0  2021-02-23
=========================
y can now be used as a decorator to debug (keyword) argumnets given to a function.
In connection with this there are two new parameters:
- show_enter
- show_exit

Changed the name of several parameters:
- show_context (was include_context)
- show_time (was include_time)
- show_delta (was include_delta)

The parameter output_function is now called output. And it can now be:
- callable (like before, e.g. print)
- an open text file (e.g. sys.stdout or an explicitely opened file)
- a str or Path object that will be used as the filename (opened with 'a+' for each call)

The parameter arg_to_string is now called serialize.

Complete rewrite of tests, now in PyTest.


version 1.0.2  2021-02-19
=========================
Phased out Y.format() and replaced by Y(as_str=True)

Major update of readme.md

version 1.0.1  2021-02-18

version 1.0.0  2021-02-17
