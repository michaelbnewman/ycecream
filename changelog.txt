version 1.1.1  2021-02-25
=========================
The y decorator now also adds the duration of the function/method call on exit, like
y| returned None from wait(5) in 5.004965 seconds
This can be useful as a basic way to benchmark a function.

version 1.1.0  2021-02-23
=========================
y can now be used as a decorator to debug (keyword) argumnets given to a function.
In connection with this there are two new parameters:
- show_enter
- show_exit

Changed the name of several parameters:
- show_context (was include_context)
- show_time (was include_time)
- show_delta (was include_delta)

The parameter output_function is now called output. And it can now be:
- callable (like before, e.g. print)
- an open text file (e.g. sys.stdout or an explicitely opened file)
- a str or Path object that will be used as the filename (opened with 'a+' for each call)

The parameter arg_to_string is now called serialize.

Complete rewrite of tests, now in PyTest.
